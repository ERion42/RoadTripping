# Road Tripping App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is the start of a large project I'm planning for a travel app.

## Description

Road Tripping currently serves as a practice for using React as well as potential applications of the Google Maps API. Eventually, the plan is to expand it into a full-fledged and highly useful road trip application.
